    <p class="para2">This chrome extension allows users to block website that the extension has found malicous. Once
        user block any malicious website  if they want's to again unblock that website so they can do it with just
        one click.In case user is 100% sure about that the website is safe but the extension says that it is unsafe, so
        the user can add url and allow that IP address as safe URL, after adding the IP user will not see that the
        website is unsafe.</p>
